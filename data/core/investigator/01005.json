Then, word came that her father had been lost at sea, and Mama started acting strange, drawing unusual symbols in chalk all over the house. They took Mama to the asylum, and Wendy went to the orphanage. Before they took her away, Mama gave her the necklace, to \"protect her.\" Wendy stayed in the orphanage for several years before running away, deciding that she could take better care of herself on her own.",
